# Solidity Token

This project creates a simple smart contract using Solidity.

## Description

The smart contract aims to create a token system that can be used for various purposes, such as representing digital assets, facilitating transactions, or powering decentralized applications (dApps) on a blockchain network. The contract provides multiple mechanisms that aim to include the basic functionalities of a token in the Ethereum blockchain. These features contain minting new tokens, burning existing tokens, and managing the balances of different addresses.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Copy and paste the code in IDEs that support Solidity. I highly recommend using Remix, a well-known online tool for developing smart contracts.

### Executing the Program
- Compile the code (Make sure to match the compiler version according to the code)
- Deploy the smart contract
